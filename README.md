# tictactoeai
This is a unbeatable tictactoe computer based on minimax algorithm.
Minimax algorithm is a kind of back tracking algorithm where it checks all the possibilities of the games.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(b^n) and space complexity is O(bn).
The first chess engine to ever beat kasporav deep blue used minimax algorithm with less depth in tree, as there are billions of possible games in chess.

How to use:-
Type the row and column index together without space to input.
ex: you want to enter X in 0 row and 2nd column then input 02.
